We have considered an IoT scenario with independent and dependent activity cases. 
We have chosen four parallel and sequential events for independent and dependent cases, i.e., STC={IP,IS,DP,DS}. 
Each event consists of 25 random activities with two random datasets, RS={RS1,RS2} and a set of probability rates, STPS={0.95,0.9,0.85,0.8}.
