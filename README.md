Event Model (EM)

The objective of the event model is to determine the probability of achieving the goal of an event at time t. The input of the event model is a sequence of activities, their starting time, actual duration, state transition probability value, state transition case, and outcome, ie., probability of achieving the sub-goal of each activity. The event model computes the success-failure rates of a sequence of activities, the probability of achieving the event goal, and the probability of not achieving the event goal.
